Some friends and I asked questions about how many time do we have to shuffle a deck of cards to get back to the original deck. Of course, this is an easy question. But, we ended up adding more parameters like what if we have n cards. This is a simple program to help me visualize what happens. In short, it is an isomorphism between the cards and the natural numbers.

We did find a closed form, but I'll leave that to the reader. Here's a hint, think about Euler's totient function :)
